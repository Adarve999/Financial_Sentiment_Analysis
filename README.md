# **Financial Sentiment Analysis: From Simple to Advanced Methods**

## **Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates).
- Distribution of sentiment classes (positive, neutral, negative).
- Most frequent words in each category.
- Word cloud visualization for different sentiment classes.

---

## **Step 2: Simple Methods (Baseline Models)**
### 1. **Bag-of-Words (BoW) + Logistic Regression / Naïve Bayes**
- Convert text into a frequency matrix using **CountVectorizer**.
- Train models:
  - **Naïve Bayes classifier**
  - **Logistic Regression classifier**
- Compare performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## **Step 3: Intermediate Models (Machine Learning & Topic Modeling)**
### 3.1 **TF-IDF + Machine Learning Models**
- Use **TF-IDF Vectorization** to represent text.
- Train models:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**  
- Compare performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 3.2 **Dimensionality Reduction with LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)**
- Apply **Truncated SVD** on TF-IDF matrix.
- Reduce feature dimensionality while preserving sentiment-related patterns.
- Train **Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest** on the LSA-transformed data.

### 3.3 **Topic Modeling with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**
- Use **LDA** to discover latent topics in financial news titles.
- Check whether sentiment classes align with discovered topics.
- Use topics as additional features for sentiment classification.

## **Step 4: Advanced Models (Deep Learning & Transformers)**
### 4.1 **Word Embeddings + Deep Learning**
- Convert text to embeddings (Word2Vec, FastText, or GloVe).
- Train a **LSTM, GRU, or BiLSTM** for sentiment classification.

### 4.2 **Transformer-Based Models (State-of-the-Art)**
- Fine-tune a pre-trained financial language model:
  - **BERT**
  - **FinBERT (Financial Sentiment BERT)**
  - **RoBERTa**
- Use these models for sentiment classification.

---

## **Step 5: Evaluation & Insights**
- Compare model performance across:
  - Baseline models (Lexicon, BoW)
  - Machine Learning models (SVM, Random Forest)
  - LSA, LDA-enhanced models
  - Deep Learning & Transformer models
- Use confusion matrices, ROC curves, and SHAP analysis for feature importance.
